% For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them,\\ e.g.

In this chapter, we will investigate examples uses of the foreign function interface, and explore how we can write functional models, specifications, and proofs about them.
This chapter will not feature the VST specifications and proofs for the C function in this chapter, as the VST funspecs will be automatically generated using the methods we described in \autoref{genspecprim}, while the VST proofs are outside of the scope of this dissertation.
